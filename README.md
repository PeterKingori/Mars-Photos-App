Mars Photos App
================
MarsPhotos is a demo app that shows actual images of Mar's surface. These images are  real-life photos from Mars 
captured by NASA's Mars rovers. The data is stored on a Web server  as a REST web service.  The solution app will 
demonstrate the use of [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make REST requests to the web service, 
[Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) to handle the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, 
and [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) to load images by URL.

The app also leverages ViewModel, LiveData, and Data Binding with binding adapters.
